<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p> Just unpack the client in a directory of your choice and fire it up.</p>

<p> If you have never run the client before, it will initiate the menu-driven 
  configuration. Save and quit when done, the configuration file will 
  be saved in the same directory as the client. Then, simply restart 
  the client. From that point on it will use the saved configuration.</p>
<p>The configuration options are fairly self-explanatory and can be run
  at any time by starting the client with the '-config' option.
  A list of command line options is available by starting the client 
  with '-help'.</p>
<p>A detailed guide to the various configuration options is available 
  online at <a href="http://faq.distributed.net/">http://faq.distributed.net/</a></p>
<a name="service" class="h3replace"></a>

<h3>Running the client as a Win9x/WinNT/2000/XP Service</h3>
<p>A Win9x/WinNT/2000/XP service is a process that starts running when the 
computer is powered up, and does not stop until the computer is powered
down. Unlike normal processes, services will continue to run even when
a user logs out.</p>

<p>Obviously, a service does not have access to remote file and disk resources 
  that require a user to log in first. (This restriction can be nullified 
  on NT - see FAQ <a href="#serviceremote">below</a>)</p>

<p> To install the client as a service, run the client with the -install
  switch. This will cause it to register itself with the service handler,
  which will in turn automatically start the client the next time the
  computer is powered up. To deinstall a client previously installed as
  a service, start it with the -uninstall switch.
</p>

<a name="multiplexor"></a>
<h3>The screensaver multiplexor</h3>
<p>Under normal circumstances, having a client running continuously in the 
  background is usually preferred since it continues to use the idle processor 
  cycles even when a machine is actively in use. For instance, when typing 
  a letter, the machine is really mostly idle, waiting for keystrokes, and 
  the client can use that time.</p>
<p>However, in some environments, utilizing *any* cpu time while a user is 
  actively trying to use the machine may be a problem. The distributed.net 
  screen saver multiplexor addresses that issue. When activated by the system, 
  it will launch a client in the background and _another_ screen saver of 
  your choice in the foreground. If a client is already found to be running 
  when the screen saver is activated by the system, it will not be started 
  a second time.</p>
<p>Note that the screen saver and the client are different executables. The 
  screen saver multiplexor (*.scr) is of little use without a client (*.exe).</p>
<p>Not only does this permit an installation where use of any cpu time 
  is a problem, it also resolves two other issues that a client-as-a-screensaver 
  cannot: a) it does not requires storage of client buffers and/or configuration 
  file in the windows (or windows/system) directory and b) it allows 
  a user to continue to use his/her preferred screensaver.</p>

			

Installation involves...
<ol>             
  <li>simply copying the *.scr file included with the client distribution 
      to one of the following locations: on Win9x: your \WINDOWS\ or \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ 
      directory on WinNT/2000/XP: your \WINNT\ or \WINNT\SYSTEM32\ directory</li>
  <li>Once you have copied it, go to the Display properties in the Control 
      Panel and select the distributed.net screen saver as the active screen saver.</li>
  <li>Clicking on the &quot;Settings...&quot; button opens the multiplexors 
      configuration dialog. Select the client you wish the multiplexor 
      to run in the background and select the screensaver you wish to run
      in the foreground</li>
  <li>If the client had been previously configured, there is nothing 
      else you need do. Otherwise click on the &quot;Configure&quot; button 
      to configure the client.</li>

</ol>

<a name="notes"></a>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The client distribution includes a separate CUI wrapper that communicates 
  with the GUI client over pipes. Older clients can be started in native CUI 
  mode either by renaming the .exe to .com, or by using a patch utility to 
  change the executable's subsystem type to CUI.</p>
<p>The win32 CLI client consolidates the rc5des.exe (normal CUI client), rc5desh.exe 
  (hidden client) and rc5dessvc.exe (service mode client) in one executable. 
  It no longer runs as a native console session (CUI), but emulates a "console" 
  in a GUI window.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the client can be started "hidden";</li>
  <li>conagent is not loaded which cuts down the overhead; </li>

  <li>the client is more efficient;</li>
  <li>the client is not susceptible to misconfigured "DOS" settings</li>
  <li>the client can be shutdown with "close" and will shutdown the 
      client can be shutdown with "close" and will shutdown</li>
  <li>it gets rid of the "DOS box" and persistant icon on taskbar;</li>
  <li>the client can be minimized to the systray;</li>
  <li>most importantly, the client uses exactly the same source code 
      base as all the other clients on all the other platforms. This enhances 
      the client's stability since the chances that a bug will remain 
      undetected for long are greatly reduced.</li>

  <li>The client is capable of asyncronously executing client
      "modes", ie -fetch, -flush, -update and so on. Clicking with 
      right mouse button on the client window will bring up a "mode" menu.</li>
</ul>
		  
<p>It is no longer mandatory to have winsock.dll/wsock32.dll installed.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong><strong>Q:</strong></strong> What are the changes in this version of the client?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> They are listed in the file CHANGES.txt, included 
  with this client distribution.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Q:</strong></strong> Where can I find other utilities 
  and add-ons for the client?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> You can get an asortment of open source add on utilities 
  from the web site. As always, user contribution will be much appreciated. 
  See <a href="http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php">http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php</a></p>

<p><strong><strong>Q:</strong></strong> Is it possible to start the client 
  as a service and yet keep it visible on the desktop or taskbar?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Services are not supposed to be interactive. There is a special 
  category of interactive 
  services, but they are rare (like kernel debuggers), and NT only. Some 'interactive' 
  functionality may be achieved by enabling logging to file and by using the 
  client's command line -shutdown, -restart, -pause and -unpause options. 
  An attempt to force a client installed as an NT service to &quot;interact 
  with [the] desktop&quot; will not work as expected.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I check that the client is in fact running 
  hidden/as a service? <br>
<strong>A:</strong> On NT, service status can be determined in the 
  service manager and the task manager will show the client taking up 
  lots of cpu time. Win9x does not have a service manager or a task 
  manager, so you will need to either enable logging or use 'wintop' 
  or similar utility. (wintop for Windows 9x is available from the 'kerneltoys' 
  pack or at <a href="http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php">http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php</a>)</p> 

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the client's service keys/ID?<br> 
<strong>A:</strong> If you use NT, it will be in the service manager. The client's service ID 
  (shortname) is &quot;dnetc&quot; for v2.80xx and later, and &quot;rc5desnt&quot; 
  or &quot;bovrc5nt&quot; for pre-2.80xx clients. On Win9x (Win9x doesn't 
  have a service manager), the client is registered with the registry 
  as &quot;distributed.net client&quot; (or &quot;bovwin32&quot; in 
  very old versions) under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in \Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunService</p>

<a name="serviceremote"></a>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I stop the service from the command line? <br>
<strong>A:</strong> Run the client with '-shutdown' or, on NT, 'net 
  stop SERVICEID' (see previous question for service ID)</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> When installed as a service, the client cannot 
  access files on remote drives (network shares). How come? <br>
<strong>A:</strong> When installed as a service, the client is (on NT, by default) not 
  running in a user's context (there isn't a user logged in). Under 
  Win9x, where security is virtually non-existant, the client *could* 
  theoretically access network shares /once/ a user has logged in, but 
  that is obviously not a good idea :). On NT, the service can be configured 
  from the service manager to start in a context other than the default 
  &quot;Local System&quot;: Control Panel -&gt; services -&gt; properties 
  on service. there's a radio button to change between local system 
  and another account. Also if the machine is a backup domain controller, all control panel 
  choices for service userids/passwords, other than localuser, are grayed 
  out whenever the machine doesn't have a connection to the primary 
  domain controller.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> On NT, trying to -install as service from 'AT' fails, but
  works fine otherwise. Whats up with that?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> AT runs by default in a non-desktop context, and 
  the client's &quot;have a valid shell&quot; check fails. The solution 
  is to check 'interact with desktop' in the scheduler config and install 
  the service with &quot;-quiet -install&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I run the client from the Startup menu of Windows (it fires up 
  alone every time I log into Windows). I want it to be minimized when 
  it starts... How do I do that?<br>

<strong>A:</strong> The way you would for any application: 
<ol>
  <li>highlight the name in the menu</li>
  <li>right-click. A menu will pop up menu.</li>
  <li>select &quot;Properties&quot; (last option on the menu that 
      appears)</li>
  <li>change to the &quot;Shortcut&quot; tab in the &quot;Properties&quot; 
      dialog</li>

  <li>in the &quot;Run:&quot; dropdown menu (second from the bottom), 
      change &quot;Normal Window&quot; to &quot;Minimized&quot;
      -&gt; click &quot;OK&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p> <strong>Q:</strong> I want to run the client and XYZ simultaneously, but 
  XYZ destroys my crunch rate. What can I do?<br>

<strong>A:</strong> Some applications behave poorly with idle priority, cycle-stealing 
  applications like dnetc. Some applications unintentionally waste CPU when 
  they are minimized or waiting for something to happen. Other applications 
  wait for other processes to stop utilizing CPU before doing cleanup or background 
  activities. For cases like these, you can try configuring dnetc to pause itself when 
  that application is running.  You may also try contacting the application's vendor to 
  find out if there are any updates that improve its use of idle CPU.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I want to run the client as a screen saver. How do I do this?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> The client includes a screensaver multiplexor. When 
  activated, it will launch a client in the background and _another_ screen 
  saver of your choice in the foreground.<a href="#multiplexor">This is explained 
  here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I want to run the client at a higher priority 
  than zero/idle. This functionality was removed in some past version, 
  but I *really*, *really* need it or my other XXX program will simply 
  hog the CPU. What can I do?<br>

<strong>A:</strong> The support for this never actually was removed. However, 
7  be *very* careful. Windows' thread scheduling/priority 
  assignment is brain dead beyond belief. Read the text in the config screen 
  before you fiddle with the priority setting!</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> My client's window shows characters in a weird 
  font. Is the client trying to access a font not on my system? <br>
<strong>A:</strong> No. The client never loads fonts by name. It loads by 
  type/family, that is, only fonts of fixed-pitch (every 'character' has the 
  same width). The advantage is of course that the client need not know what 
  fonts are installed. The disadvantage is that if there is _no_ font at all 
  that fits the bill, GDI uses the first font that matches the other specified 
  attributes, ie font height/width etc. As a rule, the client's display will 
  be fine as long as at least the standard Windows fonts are available. </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the 'Dialup interfaces' option I see 
  in the config?<br> 

<strong>A:</strong> Dial-up detection was previously 
  available only the RAS (Remote Access Service) API. The Win32 client is 
  capable of detecting 'UP' state on 
  *non-RAS* devices such as ISDN adapters that are not RAS capable or 
  AOL's proprietary modem adapter which appears as a network cards and 
  not as a modems. The 'Dialup interfaces' list then allows you to mask 
  or mask-out those devices you do not want the client to 'see'. Windows 
  has no consistant naming scheme for network adapters: What appears 
  as &quot;PPP Adapter NdisWan'n'&quot; on NT, appears as &quot;'i' 
  Ethernet Adapter&quot; on Windows9x and the numbering sequence ('n' 
  and 'i') isn't uniform either. To simplify this, the client refers 
  to all dialup adapters as &quot;ppp[0-9]&quot; and all non-dialup 
  devices as &quot;eth[0-9]&quot;. Generally speaking, if you were happy 
  with the way lurk worked before, you probably do need the 'Dialup 
  interfaces' option now.</p>

<p> *NOTE*: If you are running WinGate (NAT) proxy on the same machine
  that the client is on, and wish the client to go online only if
  a connection is already open, then you CANNOT use RAS - you must
  tell the client to use the 'Dialup Interfaces' (specify 'ppp*').</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I share my win32 client's buffers with non-win32 clients?
  [&quot;sharing&quot; is simultaneous access via file-sharing, but 
  also manual transfer of the buffer files from one machine to another]<br>
<strong>A: </strong>Yes. It is however a good idea to ensure that 
  clients sharing buffers all have the same version number.  Read the 
  <a href="http://faq.distributed.net/">general FAQ</a> for specifics. 
  You may want to read the faq entry on 
  <a href="http://faq.distributed.net/cache/48.html">sharing buffers over a network</a>,
  as well as <a href="http://faq.distributed.net/cache/59.html">"sneaker netting"</a>.

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I have trouble minimizing the client. It sits 
  on the taskbar for several seconds before finally moving to the tray.<br> 
<strong>A:</strong> Norton Systemworks 2001 by default, runs 
  a tray icon manager for their software(Norton System Doctor, &gt; 
  Norton Anti-Virus, etc etc). I turned off the tray icon manager and 
  rebooted, and the client then minimizes to the systray with no lag.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> I have trouble using the client in conjunction 
  with MS-proxy, and keep getting HTTP error: '407 Proxy authentication 
  required' <br>
<strong>A:</strong> The problem is that MS Proxy is usually configured to requre NTLM 
  (NT Domain) authentication. So far only IE is capable of this. Solution 
  is to install &quot;Winsock-proxy&quot; client from MS Proxy Setup. 
  It works at socket level so any application can use it transparently. 
  You may need assistance from your system administrator. </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I completely remove the this client from 
  my system?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> If the client was installed via the MSI installer, you should first
  try using "Add/Remove Programs"  in the control panel. If it were not, then you should 
  run the client with the '-uninstall' switch 
  to ensure that it is not installed as a service. Then, simply delete 
  all files in the client's directory.</p>
