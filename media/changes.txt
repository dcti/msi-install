                 not running with a GUI window and output is not redirected.

                 (ie, for OGR) are no longer displayed at load/save time.

                 client runs on all elf kernels, 2.0.x - 2.4.x-preX
            imp: all: client always fetches the largest packet possible
                 and then splits it locally into sub-packets. Greatly
                 improves network throughput and reduces server load.
            fix: win32: .462 client was taking long to shutdown.

            new: all: the "update frequently (-frequent)" has been superceded
                 by "additional buffer-level checking". The new option
                 provides better control and supports one new mode
                 "update on per-project buffer exhaustion" which enables
                 old-style single-contest crunching (disables rotation).
                 See also: http://www.distributed.net/faq/cache/176.html
            new: all: out-buffer thresholds have been removed entirely;

                 updating/flushing more frequently than buffer exhaustion.
            chg: all: time threshold uses fetch work threshold > 0 as minimum
                 number of workunits to be fetched.

                 on .ini change; b) (on most platforms) to pause itself as
                 long as process/executable x|y|z|... is running.

                 version or platform changes was unaffected).

2.8003.448  new: x86: 50% faster CSC MMX core added. '6bit - bitslice'

            fix: all: pause by signal (by user) and pause by filename

                 2.7109.440 since older clients will truncate the packets.
