  | | |   |      Please report this when making bug reports.
  | | |   `----- Changes in /common/ code, or simply a significant number
  | | |          of bug fixes, gets a "build fraction" change.
  | | `--------- New cores, for any platform, will be accompanied by a
  | |            "build version" change, ie 2.7103.x to 2.7104.x+1.
  | |            New significant feature(s) also increment build version.
  | `----------- A "client contest" change follows a code freeze at which
  |              point the client is assumed to be stable. Code that
  |              would make clients incompatible with previous clients or
  |              proxies will be a accompanied by 'client contest' change.
  `------------- Denotes a client rewrite.

            imp: all: client always fetches the largest packet possible
                 and then splits it locally into sub-packets. Greatly
                 improves network throughput and reduces server load.

            new: all: the "update frequently (-frequent)" has been superceded
                 by "additional buffer-level checking". The new option
                 provides better control and supports one new mode
                 "update on per-project buffer exhaustion" which enables
                 old-style single-contest crunching (disables rotation).
                 See also: http://faq.distributed.net/cache/176.html
            new: all: out-buffer thresholds have been removed entirely;

2.8005.453  chg: client supports thresholds either as a time-factor, or
                 as a workunit-factor. -config documentation has more info.
                 A review of your settings is *strongly* advised.

2.8004.452  chg: all: .ini option spin off from the generic [parameters]
                 section into subsections is now complete. phew! Nothing

                 time again

            imp: all: threads no longer check external flags for shutdown/
                 pause state. Flags are 'pushed' instead, which reduces
                 cache footprint.
            fix: win32: win95B doesn't have a 'Lucinda Console' TrueType
                 font, so client avoids it now.

                 the use of big packets enabled and clients older than
                 2.7109.440 since older clients will truncate the packets.
