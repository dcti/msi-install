- Reinstate "Automatically start via my Startup folder" option for
  startmode.  The creation of Shortcuts within the per-user Startup 
  folder was always redirected into the All Users' Startup folder, even 
  when the full directory was specified.

- Reinstate NEWERPRODUCTFOUND check (in "Upgrade" table) to prevent
  installation on top when a newer version has already been installed.
  xml2msi's update flag blindly alters the VersionMax column of all
  rows, causing problems with this.

- MSI Product version numbers must technically be of the form
  "a.b.ccc.ddd" where "a" and "b" must be < 255 (even though windows PE
  executables don't allow all version segments to be 0-65535).  Our
  client versioning scheme violates this, but there doesn't seem to be
  any problems caused by us doing this.  Maybe we should just
  skip "b" and make it 0?

- To configure a service for delayed automatic start, you can create a
  REG_DWORD value called DelayedAutoStart in the service's configuration
  registry key under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services.
